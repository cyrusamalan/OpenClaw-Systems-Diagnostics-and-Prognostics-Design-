Build a Mission Control Dashboard for OpenClaw — a full-stack web application that provides a 
centralized interface to monitor, manage, and interact with all AI models and agents running 
inside a Dockerized OpenClaw instance.

---

## STACK
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Next.js API routes (or a lightweight Express server if needed)
- Real-time: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live status updates
- State: Zustand or React Query for data fetching and caching
- Charts/Viz: Recharts or D3 for metrics
- Docker: Expose a REST API or WebSocket endpoint from OpenClaw's Docker container 
  that this dashboard can connect to remotely via configurable host/port

---

## CORE FEATURES

### 1. Agent & Model Registry
- Display all registered agents and sub-agents in a visual hierarchy (tree or node graph)
- Each agent card shows:
  - Name, type (LLM, tool-use, retrieval, orchestrator, etc.)
  - Status: Active / Idle / Error / Busy
  - Skills/capabilities tags (e.g., "code generation", "web search", "data analysis")
  - Current task (if assigned)
  - Model backing it (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3)
  - Token usage and latency metrics
- Sub-agents are nested visually under their parent orchestrator agent
- Clicking an agent opens a detailed side panel with full config and logs

### 2. Task Assignment Interface
- A "Dispatch Task" panel where the user can:
  - Write a task description in natural language
  - See AI-suggested agent matches based on skill tags
  - Manually select an agent or agent group from a dropdown/search
  - Set priority: Low / Normal / High / Critical
  - Optionally attach context files or structured data
  - Submit and track the task in real time
- Task queue view showing all pending, in-progress, and completed tasks

### 3. Remote Docker Connection
- A settings/config panel where the user can input:
  - OpenClaw Docker host IP and port
  - Auth token or API key
  - Connection type: REST / WebSocket
- Connection status indicator (green/red) in the navbar
- Auto-reconnect logic with exponential backoff
- If running locally, default to localhost with the standard OpenClaw port

### 4. Live Monitoring & Metrics
- Real-time dashboard panel showing:
  - Total agents online vs offline
  - Active tasks count
  - Token usage over time (line chart)
  - Average response latency per agent (bar chart)
  - Error rate across all agents
- A live log stream panel with filtering by agent, severity, and time range

### 5. Agent Detail View
- Full-page or slide-over panel for each agent containing:
  - System prompt / persona summary
  - Tool integrations (search, code executor, browser, etc.)
  - Conversation history or task history
  - Edit skill tags
  - Enable / Disable toggle
  - Restart / force-stop controls

### 6. Notifications & Alerts
- Toast notifications for task completions, failures, and agent errors
- Alert rules: user can define thresholds (e.g., latency > 5s → alert)
- Notification history panel

### 7. UI/UX Design Direction
- Dark mode by default, with a toggle for light mode
- Space/mission-control aesthetic: subtle grid backgrounds, glowing status 
  indicators, monospace fonts for logs
- Fully responsive (desktop-first, but mobile-accessible)
- Smooth animations via Framer Motion for panel transitions and status changes

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES
- Abstract the OpenClaw API calls into a /lib/openclaw-client.ts service layer 
  so the transport (REST vs WebSocket) can be swapped without touching UI code
- Use environment variables for OPENCLAW_HOST, OPENCLAW_PORT, OPENCLAW_API_KEY
- If OpenClaw does not natively expose an API, scaffold a lightweight proxy 
  service (Node or Python FastAPI) that sits in the same Docker network and 
  exposes the required endpoints
- Structure the project cleanly:
  /app           → Next.js pages and layouts
  /components    → Reusable UI components
  /lib           → API clients, helpers, types
  /hooks         → Custom React hooks
  /store         → Zustand stores
  /types         → Shared TypeScript interfaces

## DELIVERABLES
1. Fully working Next.js app with all features above scaffolded
2. A docker-compose.yml that runs both the dashboard and a proxy service 
   (if needed) alongside OpenClaw
3. A .env.example with all required environment variables documented
4. A README.md with setup instructions for connecting to a remote Docker instance
